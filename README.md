## DESCRIPTION
 
The project involves diabetes patients dataset and then model is trained and predicted  with Artificial neural network(ANN) algorithm.

The dataset used for this project consists of various health-related features of patients such as Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and Age. The target variable is Outcome, which indicates whether the patient has diabetes or not (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
## Installation

Install my-project with using the command:

## RESULT
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 0.69% on the test set.
